1. Install adb on windows by running adb-setup-1.4.2.exe
   I think since FireTV stick is network based, so no need to install the drivers when prompted to do so.
   Just need adb.exe to be installed

2. Enable ADB on FireTV
   Settings -> System -> Developer Options -> ADB Ddebugging (I also enabled Apps from Unkonwn Sources)

3. Connect to FireTV stick with adb
   Open a command prompt, then run:
   * adb connect 192.168.1.111
   Here 192.168.1.111 is the IP address of the FireTV, could be found: 
   Settings -> System -> About -> Network -> IP Address   

   Then should be able to see the device connected with:
   * adb devices
   Could even get the device shell with:
   * adb shell

4. Install Settings.apk
   * adb install Settings.apk

5. Use Settings to connect bluetooth
   * Settings -> Applications -> Manage Installed Applications -> Settings
     Then "Launch application" Then Choose "Bluetooth", and select "SEARCH FOR DEVICES"
     !!! DON'T SWITCH BLUETOOTH TO "OFF" HERE USING THE FLIP SWITCH !!!
     Else, the remote control will lost, and then only could control the device using adb
     or fireTV remote App
     Then try to pair with the bluetooth mouse/trackpad

6. Install CCATTViewer APK
   Download from https://build.phonegap.com/apps/1716696/share, then
   * adb install CCATTViewer-debug.apk

7. Run CCATTViewer
   *  Settings -> Applications -> Manage Installed Applications -> CCATT Viewer
   Then "Launch application"
   When the configuration dialog box popup:
   *** SELECT "Auto start on book" FIRST ***, then input the IP address of the server
   If the dialog box disappear right after popup, then use remote control to go back 
   and then launch the app once more. Then it will appear fine.
